Hermes can be configured via a custom JSON configuration, in a file named `config.json` placed in the same directory as the binary. 
The current JSON schema to be adhered to, can be found at [**c16a/hermes:/config/config.go**](https://github.com/c16a/hermes/blob/master/config/config.go)

When running on Docker, this file should be mounted as a volume.
