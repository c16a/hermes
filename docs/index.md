# This, is Hermes

Hermes is a tiny MQTT broker written in Go. 
It is inspired by several mature messaging systems such as NATS, Kafka, ActiveMQ etc.

## Vision

#### Messaging should be easy
Developers should be able to onboard Hermes and start writing code without the 
need to unlearn their current messaging experience. 
Hermes will be cloud compatible, but you don't need to have Kubernetes running. 
You will be able to run Hermes anywhere from a Raspberry Pi, to a traditional Linux Desktop, 
a gigantic public cloud machine, an IBM-Z server, and of course, Kubernetes. 

#### Messaging should be based on open standards
When messaging systems are built on open standards, it grows the ecosystem instead of dividing it. Hermes will always be based on multiple open standards and transports.


#### Knowledge is best when shared
Hermes was born out of boredom during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the initial directions were discussed over a [**Reddit post**](https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/kisutt/tiny_message_broker_written_in_go_nothing_serious).
All discussions, and development are done on GitHub. There will never be an *enterprise*, or *premium* flavor of Hermes. 
It is however, MIT Licensed - you are free to use it however you wish to.
